## LoRA-Shaw (with curve fits) Method

### This repository includes:

#### 1. The primary module, `"LoRA.py"`, designed for conducting calculations.
#### 2. A concise Jupyter example illustrating its usage.
#### 3. A modified version of the `"tsunashawfuncs.py"` module from the `PmagPy` package, tailored for relevant calculations (refer to details in *Yamamoto et al., 2022, G-cubed*).
#### 4. Example folders named "MagIC" (featuring sample files "measurements", "samples", and "specimens" sourced from *Yamamoto et al., 2003, GJI*), "plots", "csv", and "Figures".
#### 5. This README file.

#### The python module is dedicated to computing LoRA-Shaw results, including curve fits. Further details can be found in the paper titled "*The Culprit of Bias in the Shaw-type Paleointensity and an Innovative Calculation Method*" (in preparation).

### Tips:

#### 1. To acquaint yourself with the usage, refer to the tutorials in the Jupyter file titled `"LoRA-Shaw_test"`.
#### 2. The presence of the ".gitkeep" file in the "plots," "csv," and "Figures" directories is intended to preserve the structure of the repository. Feel free to delete them after downloading the zip file.
#### 3. For successful module execution, it is necessary to install the `PmagPy` package first (refer to https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy and https://pmagpy.github.io/PmagPy-docs/installation/PmagPy_install.html for details). Subsequently, replace the `"tsunashawfuncs.py"` with the version provided in this repository (ðŸ¤” `DO NOT` forget to create a backup of the original file).
